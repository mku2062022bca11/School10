Our streamlined admission process is designed to make joining QB365 Public School simple and transparent. Follow these easy steps to secure your child's future.

We welcome applications from students who are eager to learn and grow in our nurturing environment. Our admission process is fair, transparent, and based on the child's potential rather than just academic performance.

The admission process includes an online application, document verification, parent-student interaction, and fee payment. We believe in getting to know each family personally to ensure that QB365 is the right fit for your child's educational journey.

Our admissions team is always available to guide you through the process and answer any questions you may have. We encourage parents to visit our campus and experience the QB365 difference firsthand before making their decision.
